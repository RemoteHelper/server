# RemoteHelper [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/RemoteHelper/server.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/RemoteHelper/server)

## Prerequisites

This project is done in Python 3, so you'll need to install it / upgrade first.

You'll also need to install the various dependencies.

With [pip](https://github.com/pypa/pip):

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If Python 3 is not your default python version, you'll probably need to use `pip3` instead.

## Usage

To run the server, simply do

```
$ python remote_helper/server.py
```

or

```
$ python3 remote_helper/server.py
```

inside the root directory, depending on your default python version.
